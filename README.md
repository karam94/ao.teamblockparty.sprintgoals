# AO Team Block Party Sprint Goals Application

A very simple application hacked together in roughly an hour to solve a teething problem that my team at work have been experiencing for far too long! Basically, we have quite a colourful kanban/stand-up board that resembles our team's theme (lego) and a part of that, is a coloured sprint goal graphic per swim lane.

Prior to the development of this application, it was a pain constantly searching for and passing around a Microsoft Word document (which also required everyone to have custom fonts installed for it to display properly) between members (because us developers are useless at doing the simple things in life). It was also very tedious to try and change the lego background colour of the sprint goal by trying out different combinations of Microsoft Word's image filters (it never even worked properly). As you can tell, we don't have Photoshop installed on our work laptops!

One morning, I finally got sick and tired of hearing another member of the team ask for the document to be e-mailed to them (for the 9000th time)... along with the constant context switch coming my way of "Karam, please can you come over here and help me try and change this background from blue to red"... and so thus this application was born to save lots of blood, sweat & tears!
